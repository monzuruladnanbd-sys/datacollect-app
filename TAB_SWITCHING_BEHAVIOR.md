# Automatic Tab Switching After Actions

## 🔄 **How Tab Switching Works**

After each action, the record automatically moves to the correct tab, and the UI switches to show that tab, making it easy to see the result of your action.

## 👤 **SUBMITTER ROLE**

### **Data Entry Page:**
- **Save Draft** → Success message guides to "My Submissions → Draft tab"
- **Submit for Review** → Success message guides to "My Submissions → Pending tab"

### **My Submissions Page:**
- **Submit Draft** → Record moves from "Draft" → "Pending" tab (auto-switch)
- **Delete Draft** → Record moves to "Deleted" tab (auto-switch)

---

## 👨‍💼 **REVIEWER ROLE**

### **Review Page:**
- **Review** → Record moves from "Pending" → "Reviewed" tab (auto-switch)
- **Reject** → Record moves from "Pending" → "Rejected" tab (auto-switch)
- **Delete Submitted** → Record moves to "Deleted" tab (auto-switch)

---

## 👑 **APPROVER ROLE**

### **Approve Page:**
- **Approve** → Record moves from "Pending" → "Approved" tab (auto-switch)
- **Reject** → Record moves from "Pending" → "Rejected" tab (auto-switch)
- **Delete Reviewed** → Record moves to "Deleted" tab (auto-switch)

## 📊 **Complete Workflow with Tab Transitions**

### **Approval Path:**
1. **Submitter** creates record → Appears in **Draft** tab
2. **Submitter** submits → Moves to **Pending** tab (auto-switch)
3. **Reviewer** reviews → Moves to **Reviewed** tab (auto-switch)
4. **Approver** approves → Moves to **Approved** tab (auto-switch)

### **Rejection Scenarios:**
1. **Reviewer rejects** → Moves to **Rejected** tab (auto-switch)
2. **Approver rejects** → Moves to **Rejected** tab (auto-switch)

### **Delete Actions:**
- Any authorized delete → Moves to **Deleted** tab (auto-switch)

## ⚡ **Technical Implementation**

- **Data Refresh**: Each action first reloads the data from the server
- **Timing**: Tab switch happens 500ms after data refresh to ensure UI consistency
- **Success Feedback**: Success messages confirm the action and new location
- **Error Handling**: Failed actions don't trigger tab switches

2. **No Manual Navigation**: Don't need to hunt for your record in different tabs
3. **Clear Workflow**: Always know where your records are in the process
