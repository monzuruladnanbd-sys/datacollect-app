# 🔐 User Approval & Privilege Management System

## ✅ **Complete Approval Workflow Implemented**

I've implemented a comprehensive user approval and privilege management system that ensures proper access control and administrative oversight.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **1. User Registration Process**
- **New users register** with their details
- **Account created with "pending" status** - not active
- **User redirected to pending approval page**
- **Cannot login until approved by admin**

### **2. Admin Approval Process**
- **Admin receives notification** of new registrations
- **Admin reviews user details** and assigns appropriate role
- **Admin can approve or reject** each user
- **Role assignment** during approval (submitter, reviewer, approver, admin)

### **3. User Access Control**
- **Only approved users** can login
- **Pending users** see approval status page
- **Rejected users** are blocked from access
- **Role-based permissions** enforced throughout system

## 🛠️ **New Features Added**

### **Registration System**
- ✅ **Pending status** for new registrations

## 🚀 **How to Use the System**

3. **Check status** using the status checker
4. **Login once approved** by admin

### **For Admins:**

4. **Review user details** and assign appropriate role
5. **Approve or reject** each user

### **For Existing Users:**
