# 🔍 User Tracking Implementation - Complete Audit Trail

## ✅ **Comprehensive User Tracking System Implemented**

I've implemented a complete user tracking system that tags every operation with the user who performed it and when it happened. This provides a full audit trail for all system activities.

## 🎯 **Operations Tracked**

### **1. Submission Operations**
- ✅ **Submitted by** - Who submitted the record for review
- ✅ **Submitted at** - When the submission occurred

### **2. Review Operations**  
- ✅ **Reviewed by** - Who reviewed and approved the submission
- ✅ **Reviewed at** - When the review occurred
- ✅ **Rejected by** - Who rejected the submission
- ✅ **Rejected at** - When the rejection occurred

### **3. Approval Operations**
- ✅ **Approved by** - Who gave final approval
- ✅ **Approved at** - When the approval occurred
- ✅ **Rejected by** - Who rejected during approval
- ✅ **Rejected at** - When the approval rejection occurred

### **4. Management Operations**
- ✅ **Deleted by** - Who deleted the record
- ✅ **Deleted at** - When the deletion occurred
- ✅ **Restored by** - Who restored a deleted record
- ✅ **Restored at** - When the restoration occurred
- ✅ **Edited by** - Who made edits to the record
- ✅ **Edited at** - When the edit occurred

## 🗄️ **Database Schema Updates**

### **New Columns Added to `submissions` Table:**
```sql
-- User tracking columns
submitted_by VARCHAR(255)
rejected_by VARCHAR(255)  
restored_by VARCHAR(255)
edited_by VARCHAR(255)

-- Timestamp columns
submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
rejected_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
restored_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
edited_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

### **Existing Columns Enhanced:**

## 📋 **User Interface Features**

### **Operation History Display**
Each record now shows a comprehensive "Operation History" section with:

```

👨‍💼 Reviewed by reviewer@datacollect.app on 1/16/2025  
👑 Approved by approver@datacollect.app on 1/17/2025
✏️ Edited by submitter@datacollect.app on 1/18/2025
🗑️ Deleted by submitter@datacollect.app on 1/19/2025
↩️ Restored by submitter@datacollect.app on 1/20/2025
```

### **Visual Indicators**
- 👤 **Submitted by** - Initial submission
- 👨‍💼 **Reviewed by** - Review action
- 👑 **Approved by** - Approval action  
- ❌ **Rejected by** - Rejection action

## 🚀 **Migration Required**

To apply these changes to your existing database, run the migration script:

```bash
# Copy and paste the contents of user-tracking-migration.sql 
# into your Supabase SQL Editor and execute
```

**Migration Script:** `user-tracking-migration.sql`

This script will:
- Add new tracking columns
- Create performance indexes
- Update existing records with tracking data
- Add foreign key constraints

## 🔍 **Example Usage**

When a user views any record, they'll see:

```
